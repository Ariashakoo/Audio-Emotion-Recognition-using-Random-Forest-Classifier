# Audio Emotion Recognition using Random Forest Classifier

## Overview
This project implements an audio emotion recognition system using a Random Forest Classifier to classify audio files based on their emotional content. The system extracts features from audio files and builds a model that can predict the emotion represented in new audio samples.

## Features
- **Audio Feature Extraction**: Utilizes the Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) from audio files to capture melodic and rhythmic characteristics.
- **Random Forest Classifier**: Employs a machine learning model for classification, offering robustness and adaptability to various data patterns.
- **Model Evaluation**: Includes metrics such as classification report and confusion matrix to assess model performance.

## Dataset
The dataset should consist of `.wav` audio files that contain emotional speech or sounds. Each file should have a naming convention that includes the emotion label, e.g., `sound_happy.wav`.

## Getting Started
To get this project running locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:
- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages (can be installed via pip)
